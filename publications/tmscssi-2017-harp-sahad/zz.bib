  abstract = {Subgraph matching is a key operation on graph data. Social network
	(SN) providers may want to find all subgraphs within their social
	network that match certain query graph patterns. Unfortunately, subgraph
	matching is NP-complete, making its application to massive SNs a
	major challenge. Past work has shown how to implement subgraph matching
	on a single processor when the graph has 10-25M edges. In this paper,
	we show how to use cloud computing in conjunction with such existing
	single processor methods to efficiently match complex subgraphs on
	graphs as large as 778M edges. A cloud consists of one master compute
	node and k slave compute nodes. We first develop a probabilistic
	method to estimate probabilities that a vertex will be retrieved
	by a random query and that a pair of vertices will be successively
	retrieved by a random query. We use these probability estimates to
	define edge weights in an SN and to compute minimal edge cuts to
	partition the graph amongst k slave nodes. We develop algorithms
	for both master and slave nodes that try to minimize communication
	overhead. The resulting COSI system can answer complex queries over
	real-world SN data containing over 778M edges very efficiently.},

  title = {Inferring networks of diffusion and influence},
  journal = {KDD' 10},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Information diffusion and virus propagation are fundamental processes
	talking place in networks. While it is often possible to directly
	observe when nodes become infected, observing individual transmissions
	(i.e., who infects whom or who influences whom) is typically very
	difficult. Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying network
	over which the diffusions and propagations spread is actually unobserved.
	We tackle these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths
	of diffusion and influence through networks and inferring the networks
	over which contagions propagate. Given the times when nodes adopt
	pieces of information or become infected, we identify the optimal
	network that best explains the observed infection times. Since the
	optimization problem is NP-hard to solve exactly, we develop an efficient
	approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and in practice
	gives provably near-optimal performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness
	of our approach by tracing information cascades in a set of 170 million
	blogs and news articles over a one year period to infer how information
	flows through the online media space. We find that the diffusion
	network of news tends to have a core-periphery structure with a small

	our ability to identify significant substructures in the data, a
	computationally intensive task. Here we adapt and extend efficient
	techniques for finding paths and trees in graphs to the problem of
	identifying pathways in protein interaction networks. We present
	linear-time algorithms for finding paths and trees in networks under
	several biologically motivated constraints. We apply our methodology
	to search for protein pathways in the yeast protein–protein interaction
	network. We demonstrate that our algorithm is capable of reconstructing
	known signaling pathways and identifying functionally enriched paths
	and trees in an unsupervised manner. The algorithm is very efficient,
	computing optimal paths of length 8 within minutes and paths of length
	10 in about three hours.},
